# Battleship Antarctica 

This is a group project I worked on during Year 2 in the University of Birmingham. 

This project is a pixel game that allows multiple players with different IP addresses to play against each other. While steering your ship away from obstacals to avoid collision, you can attack other ships in order to win the game. There will appear random pick-ups from time to time. The map and the scores of each player will be shown at the corner of the screen.
